# Async
JavaScript library that streamlines real asynchronous code execution through use
of web workers.

```javascript
async(action [, scope] [, args])
```

+ `action` - Function to be executed asynchronously. It's important to note
that the it needs to be serializable, so it all external references
__must__ be injected through either `scope` or `args` parameters.

+ `scope` - Scope of `this` within the action body. It must be JSON
serializable.

+ `args` - Arguments `Array` to be passed to the `action` call. All arguments
must also be JSON serializable.

+ returns `Promise` instance - Resolves with return value of `action`. Rejects
with uncaught `Error` instance. `Promise.cancel()` aborts associated async
execution.

## Worker Pool
The `Worker` pool size can be configured with the `pool` method.
```javascript
async.pool(size)
```
+ `size` - Worker pool size. Default: `8`

## Usage

### Simple
```javascript
async(function () {
  return 'Hello World!'
})
.then(function (data) {
  console.log(data)
})
```
Prints `Hello World`

### With `scope` & `args`
```javascript
async(function (x, y) {
  return this.total + x * y
}, {total: 1}, [2, 3])
.then(function (result) {
  console.log(result)
})
```
Prints `7`
